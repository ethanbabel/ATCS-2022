                    My path to Water Polo Started at just a year old, when my parents threw me in the water to teach me
                    to
                    swim. After learning to swim for years and being on the swim team for more time, I finally tried
                    Water
                    Polo during 6th grade. By 7th Grade, my small team that was associated with my swim club in my
                    hometown
                    of San Francisco wasn't competitive enough for me. Starting in 7th grade, I switched clubs to play
                    for
                    Stanford Water Polo club, one of the top clubs in the country. A few years later I enrolled at Menlo
                    High School, also near Stanford, and began to play for their high school team. Now in my Senior
                    year, I
                    have improved a lot since I first started at Stanford WPC. This past year I was the first sub on the
                    Stanford 18u A team, a top 15 team in the country, as a 17 year old. I'm also a key starter for
                    Menlo, a
                    top 20 high school team in the country, where I play 100% of all meaningful minutes. Outside of
                    Stanford
                    and Menlo, I've also played for Olympic Development Program (ODP) regional zone teams, and with
                    5-time
                    Olympian Tony Azevedo's All Star Team in Croatia.
