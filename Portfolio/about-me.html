                My path to Water Polo Started at just a year old, when my parents threw me in the water to teach me to
                swim. After learning to swim for years and being on the swim team for more time, I finally tried Water
                Polo during 6th grade. By 7th Grade, my small team that was associated with my swim club in my hometown
                of San Francisco wasn't competitive enough for me. Starting in 7th grade, I switched clubs to play for
                Stanford Water Polo club, one of the top clubs in the country. A few years later I enrolled at Menlo
                High School, also near Stanford, and began to play for their high school team. Now in my Senior year, I
                have improved a lot since I first started at Stanford WPC. This past year I was the first sub on the
                Stanford 18u A team, a top 15 team in the country, as a 17 year old. I'm also a key starter for Menlo, a
                top 20 high school team in the country, where I play 100% of all meaningful minutes. Outside of Stanford
                and Menlo, I've also played for Olympic Development Program (ODP) regional zone teams, and with 5-time
                Olympian Tony Azevedo's All Star Team in Croatia.
